Well yesterday was nice! Borodust migrated the database without any major hitches and Golbin shipped another asset pack. I've been helping out but my main focus has been on board folders and the slab-browser. 

My first pass at the server-side code was a little more broken than I expected, but all the fixes were easy enough. The UI side is also coming along.

That's all from me for today, see you folks around.

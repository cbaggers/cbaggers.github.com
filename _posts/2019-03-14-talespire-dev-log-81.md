Today has been focused on tags. I spent the morning adding tags to our assets and then the afternoon playing with the filtering code.

Here is how it is looking:

The UI elements we use are due a rewrite thanks to Unity's nested prefab feature that landed relatively recently. As such I've been trying to add this in a way we can move easily when it comes to it. I'm getting happier with that and now I just need to make the tags that have been entered appear as the little blue buttons next to the input field.

That's all for now. Seeya tomorrow.

A tiny log today as I'm heading out to see some friends now. 

Today I took a little break from engine work to look at server side. The main take has just been tweaking our the DB to store the data we want for campaigns and characters and supporting granular permissions for who can do what. Those controls may not all be exposed but it's not hurting to have it there.

When the UI for the creating/editting campaigns lands I'll expose this from the web server and hook it up.

Until tomorrow. 

Peace

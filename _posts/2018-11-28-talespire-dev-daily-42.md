Hi all, sorry for the lack of daily yesterday. I got a bit burnt out so I took a short break to get my head back on straight. Today I wrapped up some refactoring of code handling losing network connection and similar cases. Tomorrow I'm doing some work on the server side of the unique creature code. I'm hoping that's something I can get done in the morning and then looking code to move your party between board smoothly (that should be easy too).

Hopefully I'll have more details tomorrow.

Thanks for stopping by!

Not really a dev log as right now there's not a whole lot of dev going on. I've been just sitting writing an rewriting bits of the kickstarter page. It's an odd feeling as I flit between thinking 'ah your thinking about it too hard' and thinking 'man this kickstarter decides whether I have to refresh my CV soon'. Heavy.

It's odd writing this when there isn't much to report. Assets for the trailer have been made, the trailer itself is going well. Really I'm writing as it feels weird going a few days without reporting the latest to you.

We'll be letting you know the kickstarter date one week before it happens.. which is soon.

Peace folks

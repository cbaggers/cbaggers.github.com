Hi all, I'm going to delay doodles until the implementation is finished but we are changing how the fog of war works..again :p

The last version had some cases we hadn't considered and so I'm hammering out a new version now. In fact I'm doing it now and don't want to lose my focus so I'm gonna get back to that now. Sorry this is short but didnt want to leave you without an update.

Peace

Fresh out of the national holidays, we have another patch. This one tackles the following:

* Entries in the unique-creature panel should be ordered alphabetically. Previous they would go out of order in certain situations
* Minor performance improvement: avoid re-sorting the unique-creature panel on every change to a unique (such as changing position)
* Fixed an issue where the first use of the 'sample' tool did not properly focus the entry in the asset browser.

The war on bugs continues next time, in bug month!

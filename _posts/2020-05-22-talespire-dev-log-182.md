A short one this time. Between two Norwegian national holidays and my own brain, I've been struggling with focus. Progress has slowly continued on the fog of war. I've written the compute shader, but I still need to do some plumbing, so I've nothing gif-worthy yet.

Ree's work on the creature controller is wrapping up, so that will ship soon. There are a slew of fixes, and the work includes the bulk of the work for creature scaling. So once the first update has shipped (hopefully early next week), I'll jump tasks to implement the sync and persistence for scaling.

The art team has also been working away, so you can expect a new asset update soon!

I'm going to spend the rest of today around the community, so if you are around, seeya there.

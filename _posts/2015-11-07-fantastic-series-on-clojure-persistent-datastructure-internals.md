I've just had the joy of stumbling onto this series by [Jean Niklas L'orange](http://hypirion.com/about-me) about clojure persistent datastructure. I had gained a basic understanding of the theory of these before now but this series of posts break it all down really well, including the optimizations that make this datastructure (more) practical.

[Understanding Persistent Vector - Part 1](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1)
[Understanding Persistent Vector - Part 2](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-2)
[Understanding Persistent Vector - Part 3](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-3)
[Understanding Clojure Transients](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-clojure-transients)

Not only is fantastically written but Î™ believe you could work through this series and write a decent persistent vector implementation by the end of it.

Top notch!

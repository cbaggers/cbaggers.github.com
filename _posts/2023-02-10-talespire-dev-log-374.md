Heya folks!

I'm away from my main dev machine today, so no gifs for ya, but there is some progress.

I've got to the point where I can select a region of the board, submit it as a slab to mod.io and bring it back into the game. So the essentials are there. It's still janky, but I know what I need to do. 

We've also continued working on Symbiotes (our mods that slot into the right-hand side of the game). We've got messages passing between mods and the game, so you can do things like send chat messages, set up dice rolls, and listen to the results. 

We are busying ourselves experimenting with the API to work out what is clean and practical to get started with. We have more to show, but as that work wasn't done by me, I'll let that person write their own dev log about it :)

We definitely are pushing for mods to be out as soon as possible. Expect to see plenty of logs about this in the coming weeks.

Hope you're doing well.

Peace.

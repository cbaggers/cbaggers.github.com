Heya folks, just a quick one to let you know that work is progressing well. I'm currently fixing the last annoying little bugs in party line-of-sight, and then I'll be wiring all this up to the fog-of-war code.

I can't wait to be pushing this all out in an upcoming patch

Peace.

p.s. Just a reminder that fog-of-war will be super experimental. Both visually and functionality wise it is not ready for use in real campaigns. However, it's gonna be great to have it in your hands so you can start kicking the tires :)

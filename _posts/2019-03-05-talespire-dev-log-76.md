Update time again folks! Fire up steam to grab the latest fixes

We are looking to up the pace of the updates over the coming weeks so keep an eye out for new prototypes and features to play with.

This little bugfix update contains:

- A fix to sync the 'initiative mode' lineup when a player joins
- Ensure additional GMs end up in the correct game mode when joining when the game is in progress
- A fix so that deleting the creature whose turn it is, correctly sets the next creature as active
- A fix to the undo shortcut so it doesn't also select the next asset in the group when building.
- GMs no longer jump straight into the 'edit lineup' tool when switching to initiative mode.

Back soon with more!

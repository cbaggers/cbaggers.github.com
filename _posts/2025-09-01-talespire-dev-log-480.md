A quick one today.

I put in some basic code for handling language in fuzzy name search. I'm 80% sure I'm going to have to tweak how it works when we work out the UX, so I'm not stressing about it being perfect right now.

After that, I did a little work on the Discord and got set up to work on particles again. Next up, I want to add support for user-defined functions.

Back soon with another dev-log.

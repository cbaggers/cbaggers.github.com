One thing that I feel very deficient on is fluency in maths. Even though a lot of what I do when programming has a mathematical edge to it I always feel like I've turned up in France and I only know how to ask for a baguette.
I'm been trying to squeeze in sessions on <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">khan academy</a> when I can but despite their awesome award badge system it can still feel like a slog.
Today however I read this which really perked me up and has really renewed my drive and I'll definitely be taking some of his advice.

Another thing that has really been feeding my math hunger is the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cryptonomicon-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0380973464">Cryptonomicon</a> which is wonderful and I will definitely be writing a post about when I've finished it.

Well that's all for now,

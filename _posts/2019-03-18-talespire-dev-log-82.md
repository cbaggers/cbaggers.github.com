Hey again, We had planned to get a content update out over the weekend but alas that did not happen as we hadn't finished updating all the current assets. This has thus been pushed to later this week. For the midweek update I'm hoping to push the tag search (which is now working great) and the GM only dice.

'GM Only' dice rolls are special in that only the GMs can see the symbols on the faces and the roll notifications. Here is a clip of making a gm only roll and then switching between GM and player mode.

We are hoping to making the UI for the GM only roll and then we'll get this update asap.

Thanks for checking out these little updates!

Peace.

p.s. Here is the version of the tag search we will be shipping

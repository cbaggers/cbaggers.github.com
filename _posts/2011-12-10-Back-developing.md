The new job is going well but has kept me busy. It's one of those projects which grew lurchingly out of a experiment into a system whos goals keep being changed as moe information is found out.<br />A bit of a pain but still I've learnt alot. I'll certainly be posting a good few things about making daemons in python as while there is some very good code online there are a couple of tweaks to that really help when working with multiple repositries on the same server.<br />I've also taken the time to pull down my code for pressly the python library and am reviewing what I have done so far so I can see how I am going to handle the next bit. I would like to get comments working properly and the wordpress API seems to be quite good with comments, so I will be able to employ some slightly different techniques that I have had to use so far.<br />Well, times'a wasting!<br /> ciao

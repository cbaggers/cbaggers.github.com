If you are having problems with embedding youtube videos in Jekyll blogs and getting errors then check out [this link](http://www.whatwherewhy.me/blog/2012/01/17/youtube-iframe-code-gotcha-in-maruku/).

It turns out that the markdown processor doesn't like the 'allowfullscreen' part of the embed code.

Delete it and the video embeds just fine!

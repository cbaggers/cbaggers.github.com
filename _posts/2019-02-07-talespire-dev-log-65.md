Good-evening folks!

Tonight I dont have a writeup but I have a video of a simple shader effect prototype. It is just a simple vertical cutaway we can use on tiles for when your creatures are in tight coridoors. It's going to be evolved a bunch to make it more aethetically pleasing but this was just so I could prove to myself that the core idea would work.

Only the first 50 minutes of the video are about making the effect so you don't need to hang around for the whole thing. Also this is naturally a technical video so if you arent into hairy muppets rambling whilst typing lots of stuff then this may not be for you :)

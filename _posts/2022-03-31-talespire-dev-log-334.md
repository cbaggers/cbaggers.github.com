Hey folks, I’m quite frazzled today so no proper update of what’s going on. I can say though, that it’s all going well, and we are still expecting the beta launch to happen on the same date that we still aren’t telling you :P

In lieu of text content, have some video content!

This is a speedy video showing the process of connecting a HeroForge account, linking some creatures to the campaign, and showing how things respond to being unlinked and relinked.

We are still working on bugs[0], and the UI is still changing. However, we are excited to make the experience as smooth as possible. So that this could be done effortlessly, even in the heat of battle.

> Please note that you do not need a HeroForge account to play with miniatures created by other players, even if you are the GM. An account is only required for sharing your creations with a campaign.

Alright, I'm heading out.

Have a good one!

[0] that ugly lag when opening the HeroForge menu is already fixed, for example.

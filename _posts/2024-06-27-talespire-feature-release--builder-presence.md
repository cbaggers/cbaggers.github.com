With this release, we start showing GMs what other GMs are building. This increased 'presence' helps you know who is working where and on what. It brings a little of the naturalness of building together that can be lost when moving to a digital space.

As always, let us know what you think. This is not the last iteration of this tool, and your stories help us find what we need to build.

See you in the next release!

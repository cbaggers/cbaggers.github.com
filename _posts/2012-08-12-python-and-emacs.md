When I first started getting into using Emacs for all my editing I had major problems trying to get a decent Python setup working. I spent hours messing around on line getting nothing but a headache, it almost made me drop Emacs entirely. However after finding a couple of clearer tutorials I was able to bodge something together, but if I'm honest Its never felt good enough. [Luckily it seems that some lovely soul has put together this](https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/emacs-for-python#readme)! 

In the author's words, the goal is *"collecting and customising the perfect environment for python development, using the most beautiful emacs customisation to obtain a really modern and exciting (yet stable) way to edit text files."*

Next time I do some Python hacking (i.e. when I can tear myself away from Lisp!) I'll try this out and let you know how it went.

Hopefully this can help some other Python loving Emacs noobs get started with a really slick python environment.

In other news I've written a .obj file parser so I can read some 3D models into cepl (my lisp opengl experiment). I should have something to show you by the end of this week.

Goodnight!

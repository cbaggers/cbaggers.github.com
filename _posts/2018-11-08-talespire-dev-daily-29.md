Evening folks, unique creatures seem to be syncing well now and I'm on a bit of a hunt to clean up a bunch of warnings that have been piling up for a while. This touches on one rather annoying aspect of Unity where, if a script has become disconnected from a prefab (due to a rename or something, it can't tell you what the file used to be called so it's damn hard to find out how to fix it. Bites when a bunch of stuff in unity is pretty great.

Anyhoo tomorrow I'll introducing a second client and then will be doing more testing and fixes.

Thanks for stopping by!

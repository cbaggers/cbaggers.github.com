Long time no dev-log!

Just a quick heads up to let you know that there will be brief server maintenance on Monday, 25 April 2022, 10:00:00 UTC

You can see what time that is in your region here: [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TaleSpire+Server+Maintenance&iso=20220425T12&p1=187&ah=1](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TaleSpire+Server+Maintenance&iso=20220425T12&p1=187&ah=1)

We have scheduled one hour for the work, but we will only be using all of that if something goes wrong. The expected downtime is under a minute.

This maintenance is in preparation for an upcoming feature release :)

Have a good one folks.

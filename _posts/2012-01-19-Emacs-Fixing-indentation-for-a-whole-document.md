The indentation system on emacs is brilliant for most languages but manually going through and tabbing the lines to get the correct indentation is such a waste of time.

First select everything in the buffer
C-x h

Next fix indentation!
M-x indent-region

And thats it! Everything should be indented to the correct level.

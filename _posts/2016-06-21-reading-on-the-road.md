Hey,

I don't have anything to show this week as I have been travelling for the last few days. However this has given me loads of time to read so I've had my face in PBR articles almost constantly.

I started off with this one ['moving frostbite to pbr'](http://www.frostbite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/course_notes_moving_frostbite_to_pbr.pdf) but whilst it is awesome I found it really hard to understand without knowing more of the fundamentals.

I had already looked at this [https://www.allegorithmic.com/pbr-guide](allegorithmic's comprehensive PBR guide) which was a fantastic intro the subject.

After this I flitted between a few more articles but got stuck quite often, the issue I had was finding articles that bridged the gap between theory and practical. The real breakthrough for me was reading these two posts from codinglabs.net:

 - [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.codinglabs.net/article_physically_based_rendering.aspx)
 - [Physically Based Rendering - Cookâ€“Torrance](http://www.codinglabs.net/article_physically_based_rendering_cook_torrance.aspx)

After these two I hada much better feel of what was going on and then was able to get much further in [this article from Epic on the Unreal Engine's use of PBR](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf)

Now [this one](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/hoffman/s2013_pbs_physics_math_notes.pdf) I probably should have read sooner, but it was still felt good to go through this again with what I had gained from the Epic paper.

And finally I got back to [the frostbite paper](http://www.frostbite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/course_notes_moving_frostbite_to_pbr.pdf) which is outstanding but took a while to absorb. I know I'm going to be looking at this one a lot over the coming months.

That's all from me, seeya folks.

It has been some time!

Been off on holiday in bulgaria, have got the reprap started (and well on the way to finishing), been to my first Reprap user group meetup which was fantastic, been building a small stove...and obviously craploads of stuff at work too!



SO aye, sorry for the quiet spot, I'm back and blogging.

Ciao

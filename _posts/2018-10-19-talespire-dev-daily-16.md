Almost forgot this evening's one so it's gonna have to be quick. Today I worked on the import of the occlusion data from TaleWeaver I've got a couple of small issues left where Unity's behavior mas left me a touch confused but no doubt I'm just being a dummy.

I have noticed a shortening of these dailys over the last few days but fear not, they'll be getting a bit longer as things get exciting again :)

Peace

Today is a short but sweet one.

Ree has been hunting down bugs in the new building tools and I've been working on the automated test suite which we are using to validate the building code[0].

That and of course the pre-orders are out, so we have been keeping an eye on things there.

Righto, I'm gonna get some sleep.

Ciao!

[0] I'll probably put a little more detailed info out on that another day

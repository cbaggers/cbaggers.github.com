If you have an error in the Windows event log with no decent information, try this site out: <a href="http://www.eventid.net/">http://www.eventid.net/</a>
It will take a event-id and source or just the vague error message and give a decent rundown on what might have happened. 
I'm getting a lot of these turnign up in Zenoss these days!

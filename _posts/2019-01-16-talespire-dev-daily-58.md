Evening all, only a quick one tonight as I'm super tired. However I can let you know that we just had a pretty exciting planning session where we went through a bunch of designs of ways to improve the building system. From walls to thin corridors and from floors to props, the next iteration of the building system could be very interesting.

Not everything will be solved in the way that seems most obvious but when we have finished some prototype and have something to back up our ramblings we'll put out a video (maybe a stream) where we talk about the design issue, our findings and where we are taking it.

Probably a month out but we'll certainly keep you posted. Also don't worry this wont delay the next batch of people admitted to the alpha, we'll be letting more of you in before the new system lands.

Until tomorrow,

Ciao

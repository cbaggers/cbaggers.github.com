WOOOO!
I've finally got the opengl demos opening in lisp. This has been a fecking nightmare as I am really not used to installing lisp modules or knowing what the hell to do with them when I have....turns out its all easy with quicklisp but until you know what to do with it its just another bloody mystery.

I'll post a decent writeup another day but this will go a good way to let me start experimenting with generating 3D geometry in lisp.

Ciao

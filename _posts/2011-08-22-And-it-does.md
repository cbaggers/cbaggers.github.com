Sweet I'm sorted for a client now.
For those on Ubuntu who are tyring to get their client to talk to a wordpress hosted blog the path you need is:
http://yourblog.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php
Don't worry about looking in the settings to 'remote publishing' thats an option for those who host their own wordpress blog.
Awesome well now to business!

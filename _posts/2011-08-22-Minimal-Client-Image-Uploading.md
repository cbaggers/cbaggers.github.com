As mentioned before I'm using "Blog Entry Poster" on ubuntu. Its small and fast and well check out how little there is to it...

I'm using this as an opportunity to test the media uploading as apparently its just drag and drop...if you see the image above, it is!


EDIT: Bugger...I'll have to dig into that then!

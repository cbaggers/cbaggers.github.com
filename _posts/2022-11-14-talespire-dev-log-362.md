Heya,

I'm hopefully wrapping up work on the "move whole AOE" feature today. There are only a couple of things left.

The first is we need a better visual. The boxy thing I have in the clip below won't do.

The second is testing network play. This is the only one that could delay things. I don't anticipate any problems, but that is often the case :)

After that, I'm switching to two tasks:

* Catching up with some poor folks I've left in the lurch with bugs for a long time.
* Performance fixes required for the macOS beta

Those two will likely fill my next week, but I'll drop in to let ya know how it's going.

Ciao

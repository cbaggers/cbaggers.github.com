Allo!

After releasing the AOE markers feature, the number one request we got was to add a way to move an entire AOE in one go. This week I've been working on just that.

In the clip below, you can see a square that you can grab that lets you move the whole AOE. Of course, these are dummy visuals that are just there to help me develop the feature.

Our plan is to make the visual a ring surrounding the handle. That way, you can grab the handle to adjust just that point or the ring to move the whole AOE.

The implementation so far has gone well. It requires a slight adjustment to the save format to support the feature, but that is already underway. I'd love to get this out this week, but

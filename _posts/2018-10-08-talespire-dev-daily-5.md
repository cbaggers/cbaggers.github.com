Hey all,

The planning weekend went really well. We whiteboarded out the new visibility system and the code that handles where is walkable. The will no doubt be changes to the design but we can see how that goes this week. We also ran through the core user journey and planned out the UI, data requires and systems that still need making. Whilst I dont have specifics for you right now I am even more confident that you folks will have some form of early access in your hands this year.

I started the steam login integration. Thanks to [steamworks.net](https://steamworks.github.io/) the unity side was easy and the server side was just basically a get request so no issues there.

I do want to clarify that Steam will not be the only way to log in. We don't want to force people into a specific platform so we will have a few options when the release comes out. It may be what we use for the alpha though, we shall see.

Right, I'm tired so I'm going to stop coding now and chill.

Peace

p.s On the left is a test of some generated lower res information to be used in the visibility system.

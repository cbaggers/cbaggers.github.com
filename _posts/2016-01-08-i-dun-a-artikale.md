I work on [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com/) as my day job (which is awesome) and have to deal a lot with interop with java/objc (which are not :D).

In the course of making, remaking, refining and smashing-my-head-against bindings I came to some conclusion about bindings. This article is about the work Olle (another awesome fuse employee) and myself did and what the first result looks like.

I've been using <a href="http://pyshell.sourceforge.net/">pyshell</a> as my interactive python shell of choice for quite a while now and being quite happy with it apparently blinkered me as I missed the fantastic <a href="http://bpython-interpreter.org/">bpython</a> . It's CLI based and provides in-line syntax highlighting and autocompletion, if the others arent quite doing it for you give it a try....hell, give it a try anyway!

Hi folks, 

Just a quick log for today. I've tweaked the visuals of the build preview we will show for other GMs. I added a new shader and UI to show the dimensions of any region of tiles the GM is dragging out.

I've also started working on a tool for a 3rd party to take their assets and produce tsMod files. We'll chat more about that and who it's for another day :)

Alright, I best be off,

Have a good one folks!

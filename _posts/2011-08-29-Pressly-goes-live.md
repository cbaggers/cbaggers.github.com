And we are up on launchpad, got to say the information provided by the Ubuntu Developer week logs was stellar and really helped me get going.

I'm much more used to writing things either just for work or for my own use so getting code out there in this way feel great.



For those who want to have a tinker, you can find it <a href="https://launchpad.net/pressly">here</a>.



I'm also beavering away at getting my Active Directory library up on line soon. I'll keep you posted on that as it develops.

Today I fixed the issue that all GM shared one flashlight. I also started looking into [this issue](https://github.com/Bouncyrock/TaleSpire-Alpha-Public-Issue-Tracker/issues/66) where removing GM permission from a player doesn't close some of the GM UI they have open. I think I'm on the right track with that one so hopefully I'll have that one done in the first few hours tomorrow.

Alright that's the most interesting stuff.

Peace

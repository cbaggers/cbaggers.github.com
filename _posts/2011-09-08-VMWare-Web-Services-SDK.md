Somehow this managed to pass me by but vSphere has a webservices interface. I really want to look at writing a python wrapper for this sometime in the future! If you are venturing down this path have a peek at these webinars: <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-10751">http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-10751</a>



Hope it helps

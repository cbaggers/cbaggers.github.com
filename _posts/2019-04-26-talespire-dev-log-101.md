Today there isn't much to report as I've carried on with the prop system. We will be able to add this without breaking anything that currently exists.

We will probably deprecate all the tiles under the prop section and then provide all the same assets using the new system. This means existing behaviour is maintained but anything new will have the new behavior.

As usual work still rumbles on and we'll be sharing more as it happens

Peace

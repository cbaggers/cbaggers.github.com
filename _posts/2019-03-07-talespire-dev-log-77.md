Today I was looking into a couple of features that have been on the wishlist for a while, deleting campaigns and focusing on history events. The video above shows the WIP of the latter.

That bit is nearly done but I need to tweak how I'm handling doors/props etc. Shouldn't take much longer though.

The delete campaign feature is done except for an annoying UI issue but that just down to my infamiliarity with the system, I'll bug @Ree about it soon and we'll have it done in a jiffy.

Hopefully this will mean a new update by the latest Monday.

Time to sign off.

Peace!

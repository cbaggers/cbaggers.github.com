Hi again folks,

Today, I [continued](https://bouncyrock.com/news/articles/talespire-dev-log-418) working on our custom mesh format. The image below shows some of the progress.

This is the first mesh I've taken from Unity to our format and back again.

With that working, my next task for creature modding is to work on how we will store textures on disk. I should be able to work on that tomorrow, although there may be other Bouncyrock work that will take precedence. We shall see :)

That's all for today,

Ciao.

Todays daily is short.

FAILURE!

So far today I have failed to make a fill implementation I'm happy with. I know the exact approach I'm going for an have made some progress on the steps after extracting the reachable region, but the damn fill has been eluding me.

In the last few minutes I've started another way which, whilst will require a bit more bouncing around the tree, is a much simpler implementation.

Hopefully tomorrow it will be working and I can yak about that. Until then it's just a day with a bunch of failures. No worries of course, failures small and large are pretty much a constant when coding new things so its just a sign of doing things :)

Goodnight

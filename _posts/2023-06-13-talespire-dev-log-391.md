Morning all!

I waited until today to put out the maintenance ui update as I wanted to do a bit more testing. I'm prepping that release right now, and it should be out within the hour.

We are also scheduling downtime on Thursday so we can move to our new server infrastructure. We are super excited about this as it will give us far more stability, insight into our systems, and new ways to scale.

You can find the maintenance time in your timezone at this link: ![maintenace time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TaleSpire+Server+Maintenance&iso=20230615T12&p1=187&ah=1)

I've got to rush off now to work on the release, but here is a little clip of the maintenance UI before I go.

Ciao!

A quick update tonight.

Work continues of the fog of war. I've been fixing bugs and implementing the code that handles cleaning up fog-of-war jobs when transitioning boards. I still think there are some memory bugs, but it's all going in the right direction.

Ree's work on the keyboard movement has gone well. We've found a couple of smalls bugs in the line-of-sight and creature scaling code, so we'll get those fixed up asap.

Peace

p.s A quick video showing what the 30 unit radius of the fog-of-war update looks like

On the last community stream, someone asked whether Bouncyrock gives us employees time to do our own projects. I said that we don't have an official policy around it but are open to any of us requesting that. I'm not sure if it stuck in my head, but I realized having a few study days a month would be really helpful. 

So, this month, I've started a habit I hope to keep up with going forward. I'll take three work days for study towards the end of each month. Like most folks, I've got years of bookmarks and a bunch of books in the queue to read, and having dedicated time to get into things will be great.

I took my first one on Monday, and Thursday was my second. I'm unsure if any of this will interest you, but here we go.

I've started working through [Projective Geometric Algebra Illuminated](http://projectivegeometricalgebra.org/), a fascinating book by Dr. Eric Lengyel. I'm no mathematician, but my hope is that this will provide tools that unify a bunch of different mathematical concepts I've dealt with before. It seems to set things out in a way that extends naturally across and between various dimensions.

I'm slowly working through the first chapter, which revisits the classical approaches. I've reached quaternions and got a bit stuck doing the (admittedly simple) derivations of the multiplication rules. I bashed my head against it for a bit, and after a chat with Chairmander, I understood what I got wrong. Good progress, but by then my brain was a little cooked on the math front, so I decided to switch to something else.[0]

Next up, [The Garbage Collection Handbook](https://www.google.no/books/edition/The_Garbage_Collection_Handbook/kM6NDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0). This lovely tome is one I've started, but got distracted from, before. It's not directly related to anything I'm making, but memory management is always a fundamental concern, and reading about all the approaches and trade-offs of such a practical problem is very cool. I happy whiled away some time reading the first chapter and am excited to jump into the second in my next session.

In the evening, I had a real treat. The font designer who is making the TaleSpire font graciously spared a bunch of time to talk about fonts with me! Getting to sit down with anyone who is an expert in something is a blast, and two hours just FLEW by. Amongst learning lots of random things about the challenges in making fonts, I also got to see our new font[2], which is nearing a testable state. Having proper support for [Latin](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/latin) and [Cyrilic](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/cyrillic) will be great, and we have a good idea of where to start with CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) support too.

All in all, Thursday was grand. 

On Friday I worked on settings, and I'll take my last study day today[1].

Hope all is well for you folks,

Peace.

[0] I'm also revisiting good ol' highschool algebra. There are so many things that have faded from school, so going through those materials has been a nice refresher.
[1] Although we are now in September, I'm taking my last study day then as it fits in better with home life.
[2] It's styled very similarly to the current one. But this one is good :P

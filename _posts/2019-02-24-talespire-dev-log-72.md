A quick sunday update for you.

Today I've been looking at [this issue](https://github.com/Bouncyrock/TaleSpire-Alpha-Public-Issue-Tracker/issues/68) and looking into how best to tackle it. I've come up with a fix I'll be coding and testing tomorrow morning but the issue was interesting as it gave me a change to look at the GM Request code with fresh eyes. Once again I'm seeing places where an effort to keep things extensible for an uncertain future has really just led to a more complicated system than neccessary (or rather one that has needed patching to line up with the actual behaviour we wanted later). I'll definitely be looking at making this dumber in future.

This post is super vague :D but explaining the details (in this case) doesnt bring with it any cool takeaways.

Seeya tomorrow!

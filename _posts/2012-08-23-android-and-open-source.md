I had an annoying realisation the other day that, while my computers run almost entirely libre software, the majority of the apps on my phone were not open at all. 

Given the awesome fact that a huge percentage of mobile devices are now running an open source OS the fact that the apps aren't is a bloody joke. 

Luckily some great people have put together an 'App Store' which only contains libre software, its called (FDroid)[http://f-droid.org/]

There are some great wee apps and as the apps are made to be free there are no adverts either.

Enjoy!

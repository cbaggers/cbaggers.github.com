This is one of those ideas I expected to go away after a while but its still here especially after skim reading the <a href="http://cbaggers.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/my-reading-for-tonight/">session IRC log from the last post</a>:



I find watching a IRC + slide session is much better than reading the logs later. Even though its both just text and visuals it feels more 'alive' the first time round.

I think I may make a sort of replay tool which lets you watch the session and changes the slides at the correct times. I'm not sure if I will integrate this into something like <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lernid">Lernid</a> or make a tiny dedicated app...hmm!



Yet another thing for the todo list!

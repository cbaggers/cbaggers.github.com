The code for my AD library ADdled will be uploaded later this week to <a href="https://launchpad.net/addled">this page</a>.



It will have basic functionality for connecting, searching and retrieving data and the beginnings of the write-back methods.



I'll be expanding this along with <a href="https://launchpad.net/pressly">pressly</a> over the coming weeks  in order to get them up towards something I'd be happy calling a beta.



In that time I also need to get myself familiar with the unittest system for python as I want to have decent test coverage. One thing I don't know yet is how to write decent tests for systems that require login details...ah well I'm sure that will be revealed soon enough!



Goodnight all!

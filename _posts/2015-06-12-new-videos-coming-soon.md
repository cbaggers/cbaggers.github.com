Last week was a good week for making videos, and cepl in general. With the big merge, primitive osx support and sampler objects it has been feeling like cepl is progressing very quickly all of a sudden.

I have had to throw away a couple of videos I was going to release however, as they are now very out of date. I had hoped to get full blend-mode support in last night but as I failed at that it will likely be merged in in the next 3 days. The next videos in the pipeline will be on sampler-objects and blend-modes, I will the re-record my "Intro to CEPL for people who know GL", as this was one of the casualties of the last week's progress.

Thanks to anyone who is reading this, Ciao

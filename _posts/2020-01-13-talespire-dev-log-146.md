Hi again,

Today has mostly been spent on implementing 'paste'. Although not finished, it is coming along well, and I think I've hit most of the surprises the implementation has for me.

I also think I've worked out some details to deleting single tiles that mean we can defer shifting data around until later. Amusingly (to me), I've left deleting of single tiles until now as it is, in some ways, more complex than deleting a selection of tiles. I'll probably write a little more about that another day.

This is all rather vague, isn't it? I've been sitting here thinking of more to say about it, but really it's just been a day of coding and pondering.

Yup... that really is all for today.

Ciao!

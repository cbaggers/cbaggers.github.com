Ok so I am currently moving away from WordPress as I really would like to be able to edit my blog fully offline and preferably have it managed via some dvcs. 

I've was looking at [Blohg](http://blohg.org) for a time but the documentation for Jekyll combined with JekyllBootstrap was too nice a combo not to use.

So this is it, my new home, hope you enjoy it!

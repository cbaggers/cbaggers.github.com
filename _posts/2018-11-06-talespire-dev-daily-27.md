Evening all, another small update. I've continued work on the syncing of unique creatures which are creatures that can move between boards and who's stats, hp, inventory, etc are stored on the campaign (player controlled characters are the main example).

Tomorrow will be spent testing what I have so far and trying to find where it can break down, hopefully Thursday will then be spent cleaning it up. As such it's going to be a couple more days with short dailys as there is very little to tell. It's just small iterations and plenty of thinking :)

Until next time,
Peace

Today has been a tricky one. I found a significant bug in the building synchronization code that is definitely going to cost me a day or two. Given that I'm already behind on where I wanted to be this is a bit stressful. As I have an understanding of this problem but still have a good few unknowns on the server side I'm going to task switch for a few days and see if I can get a better overview there.

Not a fun update to write but here's to the next few days regardless.

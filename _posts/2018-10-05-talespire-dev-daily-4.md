Today I put aside the undo/redo work and focused on fixing little bugs instead. As I'm off to [@jonnyree's](https://twitter.com/jonnyree?lang=en) place this weekend I really wanted to get the recent stuff as stable as possible so we can merge it to master before I dive into another chunk of the project.

That mainly involved fixing some bugs around network IDs, a dumb mistake in serialization, and a bunch of little cleanups.

Hmm, there's not really much else to say. Ah well, there are plenty of days like this.

Seeya folks, back on Monday with the new plans

Peace

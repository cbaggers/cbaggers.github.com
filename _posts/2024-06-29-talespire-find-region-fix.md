This patch fixes an issue that you may have been bitten by. Starting fairly recently, creating a campaign could take a very long time. The reason was that it was taking a long time to find the correct region in which to host the campaign.

We have rewritten the code, and it's significantly faster now. However, if you do experience new issues around making campaigns, please let us know, as we are very eager to squash these bugs. You can report at https://feedback.talespire.com, and you can chat about all things TaleSpire over on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/talespire).

Hope you're having a good weekend folks.

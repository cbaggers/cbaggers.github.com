2 days back I started getting into coding in the evenings again. For a while my brain has not been into it but it looks like I might be back at last.

So far I havent done much but tonight I'll be doing another stream where I will try to implement [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). 

That's all for now, except that if you are an old fan of Command & Conquer you can get the whole game here for free http://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/cnc95upd/cc95p106/ . It looks sketchy but it's legit and DAMN it's fun :D

Peace all

A small 'still working' update for the last couple of days. Ree has continued with terrain experiments and business work. I've been playing around with Unity's `BatchRendererGroup` type to learn what we have in our toolbox as we start to rewrite how we handle the rendering of tiles and props.

More coming soon.

Ciao

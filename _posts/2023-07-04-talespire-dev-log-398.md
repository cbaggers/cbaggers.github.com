Hey folks,

As expected, I've been working on the community-mod browser so we can have an in-game way to install Symbiotes when we make that feature public this week.

Here is a little clip of that in action:

I'm currently fixing smaller bugs and UX things, and that's what I'm going to get back to now.

Have fun folks!

Hi again folks,

Work continues at speed over here. We will have another patch out for you pretty soon that fixes some mouse glitching, scroll speed issues, and a bug that meant people were stuck on the main menu.

As well as that, work has restarted on other features. I've been working on one nicknamed "tactical rulers." The idea is that in tactical play, it is often nice to be able to leave the ruler on the table for a minute while doing things like moving creatures. This feature seeks to support that.

> Note: this is an early test, hence the unused icon in the menu

Another benefit is that, in the future, we can add more features to the ruler right-click menu, such as turning them into markers for area-of-effects spells and such.

That's all for the moment,

I hope you have a great day.

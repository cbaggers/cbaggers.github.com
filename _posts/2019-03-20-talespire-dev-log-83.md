We've had a lot of good days of progress so it was about time for an annoying one.

Today I was looking to push some server side changes to allow GMs to set a default board for a campaign, this would be the one that you join automatically when launching the campaign. However when I pushed the code to a new staging instance I was getting and instance with the update to date database schema but the code from back in January.

It seems that earlier in the year I must have messed up our staging server machine image. This means that tomorrow is going to have to be looking into that and fixing that up. The initial creation of those images was a pain in the ass and I expect this to be no exception.

Ah well, that's just how it goes. It'll be fixed soon enough.

Let's see if I get it tomorrow,

Goodnight

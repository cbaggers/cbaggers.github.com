Hey again folks,

As planned today, I focussed on saving/loading and getting cone AOE to work correctly.

That worked.

Next up will be getting pixel picking working with the AOE handles. This will take a bit of work to do efficiently. I can't just reuse the ruler code as that only needed to handle up to sixteen rulers at a time, whereas this should be made to handle thousands efficiently. I know what tools should allow me to do this, so I just need to find the form I like.

I'll keep you posted :)

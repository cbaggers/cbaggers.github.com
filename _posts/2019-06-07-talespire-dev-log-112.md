Heya all, time for a quick behind the scenes again.

Those who have been keeping count since the dev stream will know that we are only a couple of weeks to go before we should be doing our kickstarter. We really need to focus on this so we will be pretty much stopping updates to the game for the next couple of weeks. I'm going to get the 'duplicate board' feature shipped this weekend and then I hope to fit in some bugfixes, but I think this is what we need to do to make sure we get everything done.

Other than that I finished v1 of the 'duplicate board' feature mentioned above. It's a little rough around the edges but nothing not acceptable for an alpha. We just need to make an icon for that now and it's ready to ship.

Not much more to say other than thank-you once again for caring so much about our little game.

We'll do our best.

Only a quick one tonight as it got late whilst I wasn't looking and I should get some sleep :)

Today I pushed the server changes to support default boards to production. That went smoothly and the feature is working well internally, we should be able to get that to you this Thursday (if all goes well).

I then exported all the errors that have been automatically reported to our server and I've started going through them. I've already found solutions to a couple of bugs but there naturally are many more. One particular annoying one that has been reported is that sync of atmosphere settings can stop working.. that sucks and so I'm hoping to see *something* that might give some clues to what happened there.

Until tomorrow.

Peace

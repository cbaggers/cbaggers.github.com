Hey again folks,

I hope you've had a good holiday season. I've finished Christmassing it up, so I am getting some work done before the close of the year.

I would have loved mac support to be wrapping up, but I'm waiting on news from Unity regarding the shader bug. 

Instead, I got back to persisting initiative. I had it mostly working before Christmas, but trying to ship right before a holiday is a fool's game, so I left it. 

Today started suboptimally as the internet was down. Turns out a local distribution box[0] had frozen. Luckily the ISP was quick at getting out, so by mid-afternoon, I was back in business.

A little bug-fixing later and I have this:

![initiative order persisting](/assets/videos/persistInitiative.gif)

Which looks pretty decent. I'll prod it some more tomorrow and see if it's ready to ship.

That's all for today, 

I'll be back with more soon,

Seeya

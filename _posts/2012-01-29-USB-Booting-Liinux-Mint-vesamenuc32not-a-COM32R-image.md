Just chilling with <a href="http://twitter.com/cambriangirl1" title="@cambriangirl1"></a> and she's getting Linux Mint installed on her netbook but ran into this weird problem.

Background:
She used 'startup usb creator' on ubuntu 11.10 with the Linux Mint 12 full DVD which worked (without persistence file) but when she booted the netbook it came up with this error:
<em>vesamenu.c32:not a COM32R image
boot:</em>
Turns out there's a full fix but if you just need to get Mint installed then hit tab type 'Live' and hit return.
It'll then boot into the live image and you can install without a hitch. Obviously if you need the to use the image regularly you should consult the linux mint forums for a real fix. 
Good luck all
Ciao

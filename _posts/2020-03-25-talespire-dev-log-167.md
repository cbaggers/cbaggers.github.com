Quick one as I'm dead tired and am getting straight to bed after this.

No surprises here; we are working on the beta :p. Bug fixes everywhere. @Ree has been working on the GM blocks, UI, input system, cutscene mode, and more. I've been mainly working on fixing issues in creature sync, long-running server services that clean up old sessions & board snapshots, and other stuff that is a blur.

The production servers are up, and we are now testing internally on those. My focus is bug-fixing from now to the release.

Right after some sleep of course.

Goodnight all

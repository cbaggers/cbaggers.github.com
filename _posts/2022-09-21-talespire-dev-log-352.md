Hi again,

This is a quick one to show you progress with the lasso.

As you can see, we can now generate the mesh that fills the lasso. The visuals are all for debugging and not how it will look in-game.

Now I have this, we can start using it with the rendering portion of the selection code.

I would be starting on this first thing tomorrow. However, I had a nasty discovery today at the dentist, so I'm back there tomorrow to get it fixed. The odds are that I will be in a decent amount of pain afterward, so I'm not expecting to get any work done.

Sucks, but the alternative is worse.

Alright, I'll check back in when I'm coding again.

Peace.

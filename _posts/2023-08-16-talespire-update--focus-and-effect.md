In this update, we have a fix and a feature.

GMs can now right-click on rulers made by other players and turn them into AOEs.

We have also fixed a bug where switching back to the TaleSpire window could cause 'jumping' due to inputs that occurred while TaleSpire wasn't focused. Thanks to all the folks who provided info on this, it's been a long-term bug, and it's good to be squashing this one finally.

That's it for today. We've got lots more coming this year, but we'll save that for the dev-logs.

Ciao

Happy new year!

We will be performing server upgrades at 11:00 UTC on Monday, the 3rd of January. You can see what time that is in your region here https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TaleSpire+Sever+Maintenance&iso=20220103T12&p1=187&ah=2

We have scheduled two hours for the maintenance, but if all goes smoothly, it will take much less than that.

The upgrades aim to fix a logging issue we have had for a while and add the code for the upcoming HeroForge integration.

Have a great weekend folks.

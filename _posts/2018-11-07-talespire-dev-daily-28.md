Today has been spent in a test and fix loop. Every now an again I find something that I had missed or put off is actually required and then I have to push some changes server side. I'm fairly happy with that process so I'll probably write a post on it sometime.

Tomorrow I'll be carrying on with the same as today. I got some error to do with Photon IDs when spawning the unique creatures so I'll start with that. Then it'll be hooking up the calls to update server side info on the unique creatures.

Seeya tomorrow

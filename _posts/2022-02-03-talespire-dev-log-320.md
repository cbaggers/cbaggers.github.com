Good-evening all,

I am exhausted right now but didn't want to leave another day without a dev log, so here is a tiny one.

I've continued work on trying to make some support tooling. It's clearly one of those less fun things that my brain doesn't want to do, so it's been a bit of an uphill struggle.

I'm over at Ree's for a few days now, and tomorrow we dive into HeroForge stuff again. I'm very excited about this and will let you know how it goes.

Right, I'm off to bed. 

Seeya folks

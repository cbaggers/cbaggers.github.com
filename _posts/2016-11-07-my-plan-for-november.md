I've been writing up what I've been up to every week on a site called [everyweeks.com](https://everyweeks.com). It was started by some friends and I've been trying to keep myself to it. However it has meant I've been bad as posting here.

Before now I've felt it rude to just dump a link here each week. I thought I should be writing fresh content for each site. But fuck it, if the choice is a weekly link to an article or a dead blog..I choose the link.

So here is [this weeks one](https://everyweeks.com/entry/5820e2d0e25a9c9c7573b9d6). It's a plan of something I want to make this month.

A slightly unusual one today. I needed to prototype the approach I want to use for TaleSpire's line of sight and I decided to try doing it in a couple of hours on my lisp stream. Here is the result:

We got it working but right at the very end of the stream so there isnt a sexy payoff. We'll revisit this to make sure it's working as expected and then reimplement it in Unity.

WARNING: The stream contains a lot of parens :D It's also built on prototypes from other episodes so sorry that we dotn go into detail on how most of it works.

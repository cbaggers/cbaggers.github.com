Its' wonderful just to see some of the people involved and their passion. Watch this after you have had your fill of the landing itself.

It really feels like the start of something huge again, the SpaceX docking had me tearing up and this just caps it off for me, Well done to everyone involved, I cant wait to watch the next few years of this.

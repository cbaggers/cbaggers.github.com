Nothing substantial today, I'm afraid. That last day or so, I've had something like writer's block for coding, so I've moved my weekend a bit sooner.

I had started looking into fog-of-war, but I've got nothing new to report yet.

When I'm rested up, I'll dig back into a few tile related bugs that have been reported this week, and then I'll get back to the fog of war.

Have a good one folks.

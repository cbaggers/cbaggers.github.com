Heya folks,

For the last two days, I've been working on the slab upload. It's going very well.

I'm currently cleaning up a lot of little issues with it, and then it'll be ready to show it off. The main focus the last two days was being able to edit the details of mods you have already published. That was a slog until about six hours ago when it all started to click.

I'm also pleased to say we support multiple kinds of authentication with mod.io. This means you can sign in via Steam, email, browser, and even QR code.

This is all very meh without some video to show it working, however, so I'll come back when I have fixed the remaining visual issues.

The big issue right now is that the list that shows published mods doesn't like certain kinds of filtering and thus can leave gaps between items. I know what to do, but it's gonna take some hours to code.

Right, seeya folks soon.

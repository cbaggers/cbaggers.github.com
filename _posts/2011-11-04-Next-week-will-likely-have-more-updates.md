I'm currently wrapping up  a SCCM rollout where I work and once this documentation is done I'll be glad to hand it over.

Honestly I don't know why Microsoft ever make exams. They should just set the student down with a undermaintained network and a sccm install dvd and wait.



If the student lives they pass.

I feel proud yet slightly dirty to be finishing this successfully and am ready to dive headlong into studying Solaris to purge this all from my mind!



Anyhoo hope your all well, chat to you soon!

We are back with the second patch of the day.

In this release, we:

- Fixed a bug where props in the hand would animate constantly.
- Fixed a bug where props turned into creatures would animate constantly.
- Fixed a tutorial where the keybinding information was not responding to settings changes.
- Minor fixes to wording in tutorials.
- Add help bar hints to assist with rotating tiles and props

For those who hadn't seen the first two bugs, this is how dumb it looked.

Really kills the space survival vibe when a crate is going full muppet!

We have another release going through testing now, so come back tomorrow for new goodies.

Ciao.

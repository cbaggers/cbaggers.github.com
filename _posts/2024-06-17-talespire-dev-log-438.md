Hi folks, 

Bug month may be over, but the bugs certainly aren't. Today, I've been working on some server-side bugs. I didn't want to tackle these last week while @borodust was away due to the risk of causing a problem that would send him alerts during his vacation!

All the fixes are minor, mainly cases where we weren't sending messages to the clients in response to events like boards being imported.

I will test these fixes shortly, and then tomorrow, we'll look into pushing them to staging.

That's all from me tonight. Hope you are doing well.

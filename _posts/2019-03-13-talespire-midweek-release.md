It's been 3 days and it feels like it's time for another update. This time we have two new features.

The first is that creatures now have torches to help them seem in dark places. Right click and you'll see the option in the radial menu.

The second is that the selection tool and dragging to place tiles now both show the dimensions of the selection. This can help a lot when trying to make walls line up when building big rooms.

The fires of development are still hot so we will be back soon with more goodness.

Fare thee well

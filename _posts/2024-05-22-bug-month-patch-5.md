Hi again, we come bearing more fixes!

Today, we finally make sure that the creatures that have been knocked down show that state properly when placing.

We also fixed the "rename campaign" dialog so that pressing the "return" key will apply the change in the same way as clicking the button does.

See you in the next patch.

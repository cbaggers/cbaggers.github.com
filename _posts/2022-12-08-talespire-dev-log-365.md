Heya folks!

It's a short one today. Since the release of group-movement, I've taken a moment to relax. We are seeing a few crashes that we assume are group-movement related, so we'll look into those asap.

I've driven east today to meet up with Ree for a catchup and the opportunity to work together in person. Our potential server/dev-op hire is also in the area, so we get to hang out and talk shop, which is lovely! [0]

My goal is to ship persistence for the initiative list and the option for GMs to hide the board list from players next week. Thanks to those server updates from earlier this week, this shouldn't be too complicated.

And then I've gotta get cracking on the mod.io slab store integration. If all goes to plan, that will set us up perfectly for distributing creature mods!

Needless to say, I'm excited. Here's to a productive run-up to Christmas!

Have a good one folks!

Morning all,

Amongst the vision limiting and bug fixes, I've been working on a feature that lets you store dice rolls in your inventory.

The visuals are all 100% work in progress, but it feels good to get something working on this. The feature has been on my mind for a long time.

This feature is one that starts small, but as we make this behavior more universal, it will become more important. Early on the list is being able to drag things to chat messages to send them to other players, and to be able to drop them into symbiotes so others can build upon it. In time this also will include per-creature inventories and gm-containers (chests maybe) that have inventories that can store goodies.

This has been on my wishlist for a long time, so I'm glad to see some movement. It's also got me working on the dice rewrite again, which has been parked for ages (for dumb reasons I'll go into another day :/)

Peace.

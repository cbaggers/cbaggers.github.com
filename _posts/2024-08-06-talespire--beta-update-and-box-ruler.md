Hi folks,

The "AoE in initiative tracker" Beta has just got an update fixing a few bugs:

- Fix the issue that moving a tile showed the bounds of the tile at the location you moved the tile from.
- Fix a case where hide volume bounds briefly flash when edited.
- AoE names are now correctly positioned when using the "scene scaling" setting.
- Fixed a case where the GM turning your ruler into an AoE put the ruler tool into a weird state
- Fetching the initiative list from Symbiotes now contains AoEs

These fixes will be coming to the main branch soon, too.

Also coming soon is the box ruler. This has been a long time coming. There are multiple valid ways to make a box ruler, and previously we would get into that design discussion before getting distracted by something more pressing. This time, we just decided to send it and see. We can evolve this ruler over time.

Here is a work-in-progress video of it in action. We are not happy with the visuals yet, but once those are fixed, we'll get this thing out to you. Thanks to all those who requested this feature on https://feedback.talespire.com/

The "AoE in initiative tracker" feature is looking good so far. So, barring any last-minute surprises, we should be shipping it to everyone this week.

Have a good one folks!

Hey folks,

With things calming down after the releases, I'm back working on area-of-effect markers again.

Today has gone well. I've been playing around getting the basics working and then focused on the serialization code later in the afternoon.

This is a bit early to show, but you can see something coming together:

Tomorrow I'll be testing the serialization code and looking at some bug in the cone AOE.

After that, I'll start on the radial menu stuff. The big task there is hooking it up to the pixel-picking system in an efficient way. I expect that to take a day or so.

Alright, that's all for tonight.

Ciao

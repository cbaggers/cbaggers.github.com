Another short update for today. I got the fog of war logic mostly hooked up but in a very dissatisfying ugly way. The job for tomorrow is to try and wrangle it into a more sensible form and then start testing and tweaking the fill.

The tiles are being revealed now but as we are replacing some parts of the projects others are pretty broken. An example side effect is that right now you can walk through hidden walls. This ends up being rather demoralizing as the harder you work the more broken things get. Of course the logic part of the brain knows we have done this shit plenty of times before and in a few days it'll be good again, just gotta keep grinding :)

Until next time

Ciao

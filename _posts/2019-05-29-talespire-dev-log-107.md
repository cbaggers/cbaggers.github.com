Heya folks tiny log today as I don't have much of note to report, lots of poking around with Unity and reading up on a bunch of things we may need networking wise in future.

The good thing is that the dungeon tile set is progressing well. It's been delayed by wanting to add more texture and variation to it but hopefully we get something out tomorrow.

I best run for now.

Peace.

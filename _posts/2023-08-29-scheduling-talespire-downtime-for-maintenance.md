Hi folks.

Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. UTC, we will be undertaking a significant upgrade of our backend infrastructure. This will be our biggest one for a long time, so we are scheduling four hours for the maintenance.

As mentioned, this is a big one for us. Behind the scenes, we've been working on the changes we would need to not only scale the game to much larger numbers of concurrent players but to improve our uptime while doing so. Tomorrow, we land a chunk of those improvements. With these changes, we'll be able to perform backend upgrades just as significant as tomorrow's one, with zero downtime.

See you on the other side!

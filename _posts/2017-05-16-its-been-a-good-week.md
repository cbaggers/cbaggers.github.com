[Some](https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues/1292) [other](https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues/1291) [projects](https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues/1290) have been accepted into the lisp package manager.

I put out 2 new videos:

I have added graphing functions to [Nineveh](https://github.com/cbaggers/nineveh) my 'standard library' of gpu functions for CEPL

And I'll be streaming [here](https://www.twitch.tv/baggers___) this Wednesday 18:00 UTC. The plan is to learn some graphic programming stuff by using lisp to take things apart on the stream. This week I'm going to start on the road to understanding noise functions by taking apart some gpu hashing functions. I'm a bit nervous but if it goes well I'm gonna try doing these weekly.

That's all for now. Seeya.

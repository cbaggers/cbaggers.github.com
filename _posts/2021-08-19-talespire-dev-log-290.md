Hi folks, just a quick log today to say that I'm [Baggers] taking a week off to relax. The rest of the team are still around, of course, so you'll still be getting your regular scheduled programming :)

The last few weeks have felt great as bookmarks, links, and bugfixes have been shipping. Work on persistent emotes has been picking up again behind the scenes, and the assets in the pipeline are super exciting. 

I hope you all have a great week.

Seeya!

Allo again,

Today I was working on the cutscene system and it was much more involved than expected. In short the reason was that it touched on a whole bunch of logic and UI code that (as it was a prototype) had never been written expecting multiple GMs.

Damn I just realized that's pretty much all there is to say about it without having to rambling on about pointless minutia..bummer :D

Guess that's it then! Tomorrow I'll be traveling in the morning but then will probably look into refactoring the GM request UI. Should be some fun edge cases in that.

Seeya

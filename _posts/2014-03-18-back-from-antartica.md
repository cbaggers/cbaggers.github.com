Heya folks, I've just got back from sailing to Antartica with the JST. This was simply incredible in way I just can't work out how to put into text yet, but will soon.

Also I have lots of things I want to add,fix & tweak for my lisp projects so watch this space as, work permitting, I should be putting out a fair bit of stuff this year.

Hope you are all well,
Ciao

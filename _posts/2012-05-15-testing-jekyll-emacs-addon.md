For those who are playing around with Jekyll and would like to be able to quickly create and publish posts within emacs then you may want to check out [jekyll.el](http://metajack.im/2009/01/02/manage-jekyll-from-emacs/).

I've been trying it out and it means that regardless of what I'm working on, when the idea for a post comes into my head I can C-c b n ('blog new' I assume) jot down the idea and carry on.

For anyone who needs to be able to unload ideas from their brain in order to focus on the job at hand this is a real boon.

When you have finished the draft it's C-c b P (blog publish) to move the post from the draft folder to live. I can then preview it and push to the world via git. 

Lovely!

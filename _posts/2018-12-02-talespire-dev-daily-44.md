Hey again! today has been spent taking places where we would make multiple calls to the backend and merging them into single calls. Makes stuff a bit faster, simpler and more robust.

There's really not all that much to say about that. It's a bit fiddly as it is relatively easy to introduce subtle bugs and I've been chasing down a few of those (tomorrow morning will start with squashing one).

Other than finishing that work off I'll be getting things in a place to merge into the master branch. I'm not as far along as I'd like but hopefully I'll pick up pace again.

G'dnight all

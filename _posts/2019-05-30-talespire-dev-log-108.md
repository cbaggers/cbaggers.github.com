Alright today I was mainly experimenting with asset loading. We currently have a big pause when we load assets and so naturally we need to fix that. Some of it is just moving things earlier, spreading things over frames etc, but we need to try this stuff out to see what works. 

There's not really a lot more to tell for now. Research is cool but make for pretty generic dev logs 'TODAY I DUN STUFF'.. good job me.

Tomorrow is a national holiday but we'll be back with more on Friday.

Peace!

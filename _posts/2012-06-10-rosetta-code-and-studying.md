This is really a 'note to self' but if you are learning a language and have experience with other, then the [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org) really help when you hit that problem when you yell "THIS IS SO EASY IN <insert language here>!". 

While trying out Common Lisp and I keep coming up against little problems that I would happily tap out fluently if I was coding in Python but which in Lisp leave me scratching my head. Rosetta Code has helped a few times now and yet I keep forgettign about it...Hopefully now I've wirtten this it may stick!

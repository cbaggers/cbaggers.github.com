I got less done than I'd hoped today but that's alright. We had to plan out some finer details of how the fog of war should behave under different conditions and required a few changes in how we are storing places the character has already revealed.

I've hacked out the data structure for this and am writing on the worker that will run the flood fills.

Not really much more to say right now,

ciao

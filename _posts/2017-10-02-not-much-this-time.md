My lack of focus over the weekend was disappointing so I haven't got much to report. The one thing I did get done however was to finish adding types to [my WIP lisp bindings](https://github.com/cbaggers/issac) for the [newton-dynamics physics engine](http://newtondynamics.com/). This was motivated by the fact that although I had got the basics working a while back, I had seen some overhead from the lisp code; that should be minimized now.

I think I might try using the physics bindings on this week's stream. Could be fun.

Other than that I've been reading and procrastinating. [This book](https://www.red-gate.com/library/inside-the-sql-server-query-optimizer) is now in my 'to read' list, I have no desire to make a proper database but I'm super interested in how their query planner/optimizers work.

That's all for now, seeya!

It's time for a video dev log.

While I have you here, I'm going to abuse this reach I have to pimp something non-talespire, and even non-ttrpg related.

A good friend of mine released a game last week, and I'm so stoked for him. It's called [Kandria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/), and it's a 2d open world hack-n-slash platformer, with celeste'esce smoothness of control, and a story laden post-apocalyptic environment. If that sounds at all interesting please give it a look here.

And with that I'm off,
Cheers folks!

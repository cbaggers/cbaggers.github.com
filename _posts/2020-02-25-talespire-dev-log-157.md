A good time-adjusted evening to you all,

Today I've carried on with the bug-fixing. The day started out with more planning, as my initial plan didn't cover some cases. I then spent the afternoon working on the code that handles adding assets. This seems to be going well so far.

Tomorrow I'll continue with the 'add assets' code and then look at delete. I hope to finish that on Thursday and get onto copy/paste.

Ciao.

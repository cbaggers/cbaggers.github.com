Today I needed to take a little time to be a human so less coding was done.

Before that I did get flood fill working across subsections of the board (zones). The next task is storing the results for the given character and being able to switch between different character's perception.

Those successes only appear as a couple of messages in the log right now, so instead here is a visualization of the octrees of different zones as the character moves through them

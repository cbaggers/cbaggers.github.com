Hi folks,

After the latest Photon issue, I decided to look into our options for our real-time traffic going forward. We don't have any immediate plans to change our setup, but it was bothering me that I didn't have a good overview.

That took all of Monday and half of today, and it led neatly into reading about tooling for helping the portion of the backend we host.

It has all been research, so I don't have anything specific to talk about yet, but you'll have a blog post about it as soon as that changes!

Hope you are doing well, folks
Chris

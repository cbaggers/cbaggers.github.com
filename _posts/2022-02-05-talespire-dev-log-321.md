Hi again, 

As expected, today has been about HeroForge. I've added the manager that handles pulling down thumbnails and have been reworking parts of the conversion process.

Hmm, it's very annoying how little text my day compressed down to :D

I've now merged our HeroForge branch into master. This is great as we are forced to deal with all the broken things. My plan for today is to help out with the UI where I can and otherwise to find and fix bugs.

The first order of business is definitely fixing some incorrect texture formats we are picking on load.

I'll keep you posted,

Peace.

Weekend update!

This time we have two prototype features for your testing pleasure.

The first is that you are now able to click on GM requests and history entries to focus the thing being talked about. For example if a request comes in that a specific user would like to open a door, you can click the request to jump to the door they are referring to. If you want to know which tile an entry in the history is referring to simply click it to go there.

The second feature is the ability to move creatures with the keyboard. It works reasonably well on single floors but not across floors yet. Naturally this will mature over time. Currently to use this hold down shift and use WSAD.

Alrighty, expect the next update in a few days.

## EQL!
[EQL](http://www.password-taxi.at/EQL) does look like the absolute answer to my app making prayers. It is a set of ECL bindings for QT which should mean I'm able to both use the power of real-time development, the excellent GUI designing tools of [QT](http://qt.digia.com/) and still have small executables thanks to ECL. 

The only issue is I can't install it :b !

Yeah I'm having problems compiling it just now, though I have written to the author to see if he can give any advice. Whatever I find out I will post here. 

It is no understatement to say I'm very excited! To be favourable on mobile devices an app really should be as small in size and memory footprint as possible, and this might just let me do both in one fell swoop!

Here's hoping!

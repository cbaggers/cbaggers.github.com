Morning all,

I'm currently working full-steam on getting a beta build of the group-movement feature to all of you.

Yesterday I gave the lasso prototype to some folks for private testing. The feedback was generally positive, but naturally, they found some new bugs and highlighted some annoying behaviors.

I'm now working through that list, fixing the critical stuff. Hopefully, I can get those done today.

I'll then write up the usual beta guides and tutorial videos so we can hit the publish button!

I won't promise a date, but we are close.

One big spanner in the works is that I need to have some work done on my car, which may keep me out of the office most of the day. We'll just have to see how that goes. If I'm stuck in town, I'll use the day to work on server code, which is easier to work on from my laptop.

Have a good one folks,
Ciao

Hi folks,

You may have noticed that I've been gone for about a week. The reason for that was that I caught the flu, and it's been doing a merry dance on me since then.[0]

I'm not entirely back to normal, I still run out of energy after about five hours of being awake, and my coughing sounds like some satanic accordion. But I am on the mend.

My sincere apologies to those of you who I'm meant to have contacted. It simply hasn't been possible. I'll catch up when this passes.

For those wondering, yes, this did affect the HeroForge release date, although it has not changed the month it is happening. Also, this has not given us extra time for polish, as I'd haven't been able to code at all while ill (which has been driving me crazy!). That said, other TaleSpire work has continued, and [Ree's latest post](https://bouncyrock.com/news/articles/talespire-dev-log-335-weekend-experiments) is mind-blowingly exciting.

Here in Norway, we have Easter break rapidly approaching, so we will be away for that. Ree will be along with another dev-log talking about that, though.

Thanks for bearing with us, folks. I can't wait to be back working while not rattling.

Take care

Heya folks. Today I spent a good chunk of the day continuing through the errors dumped yesterday. I'm about a third of the way through and have already got a good list of bugs we didn't have previous reported on github. Most of the these are bugs that would have occurred without the game dying so will have manifested in annoying ways.

Yesterday I mentioned that one bug we wanted to squash was the one causing atmospheres not to sync properly. This has no been fully worked out and I'll be finishing off the fix in the morning. Hopefully the rest fall just as easily.

Ciao

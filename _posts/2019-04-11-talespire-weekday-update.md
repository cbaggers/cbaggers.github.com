After the big asset drop on the weekend it's time for a small asset update, we added a little side-table that you can find in props.

In the world of new features you can now make a board in a campaign the default, this means that whenever someone joins the campaign they arrive there first.

We also fixed some bugs:
- One that stopped atmospheres syncing correctly
- One which stopped the invite box working correctly in the main menu
- And one where a creature's radial menu would stay visible after the creature was deleted (making it very easy to get exceptions)


We are currently tracking another annoying one where creatures which should be visible and in line of sight are not showing. If we can fix this tomorrow then we will push out an update just for that then.

Thanks for following our little spire.

It's the summer holidays over here, so we'll see a little less of Ree this week as he takes some well-earned breaks. However, you still have to put up with me :)

Today I've been looking at writing the batching for the rendering as we move away from Unity's GameObjects. It's slow going, but I should have something running before the weekend. This version won't have GPU-culling, but it will let me progress on the rest of the systems that need rewriting. Once this is working, Ree and I can work out the bare essentials we need for the animation system the tiles will use.

I also had another brief look into Unity's new physics engine, and I'm reasonably confident we'll be able to drive that efficiently. More on that another time.

Back tomorrow with more very incremental news :)

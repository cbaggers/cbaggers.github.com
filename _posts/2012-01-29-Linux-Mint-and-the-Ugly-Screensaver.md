title: Linux Mint and the Ugly Screensaver

Turns out that both linux mint and ubuntu 11.10 don't have xscreensaver anymore as default. This seems fine in Ubuntu as there is a simple fade to black when needed.
Unfortunately in Linux Mint it has a butt ugly colour flashing reminiscent of monitor test patterns.

To fix this you need to remove gnome-screensaver and install xscreensaver.
The details can be found in the linux mint forums, <a href="http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;t=86563#p500030">here</a>.

Hi folks,

Yesterday, I wrote the code that performs fuzzy search over the names of assets.

I'm now taking another quick look at tag search, as I need to be able to filter the tags by what kind of asset is currently of interest (e.g. creatures, tiles, or props).

This should be straightforward, and so by the end of today, I hope to have the behind-the-scenes of the tag search finished.

However. I do need to spend some time considering how language plays into search. For example:
- How do we handle translations of the asset's name?
- When we do, what do we search for? If the name isn't available in your language, which language/s do we fall back to?

This will be fine. I just need a good mug of coffee and a chat with @Chairmander, and we’ll work it out.

That’s all for now. Hope you have a great day.

Ciao

Hi folks, today I've been poking around with fog of war and working out how the updates are going to be spread over multiple frames. I'm going to keep working on this so I can select areas and apply fog to them. For now, the mesh generated will just be a big, grey, minecraft-looking mesh as we don't need to worry about the visuals for a while yet.

Ree's been working on business things today, and his work on the creature-controller has gone well too. There are still some things to work out with creature scaling over various framerates, but it's getting closer.

Back soon with more!

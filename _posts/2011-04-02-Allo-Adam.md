I'm back (who am I telling? no one comes here!) I have just got an Adam tablet after many months of waiting and the best part of a year wondering if it was vapourware. For the uninitiated the adam is a tablet with a pixel qi screen which allows viewing in direct sunlight (think kindle with all the features of a regular screen. 

It has been a major bugbear of mine for the last few years that I could only do my geeking from indoors (a limitation which has helped me cultivate the geek standard in skin pastiness!) so when I heard of this screen I knew it would let me knock this on the head once and for all.

Right so for the next few weeks i'll be posting about the adam, any hacks I undertake, and anything else that springs to mind.
Catch ye later

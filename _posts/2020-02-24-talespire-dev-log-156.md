It's a nice quick update today.

I have set aside this week to work through the nasty bugs that delayed the release. I spent today wandering around my flat rambling about possible approaches, pausing to scribble furiously on a tablet, and then repeating those steps for 9 hours.

Between that and a few chats with Ree, I feel like I've got something that should work. Tomorrow I'll start implementing and see if I've missed anything.

Seeya then!

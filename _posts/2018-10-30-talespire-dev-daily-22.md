Heya folks, last time was a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0-aj_sTWQ0) where we looked at some development surrounding the fog of war implementation. I've been hammering away on bugs, both the ones that showed up on the stream and plenty of others.

Things are starting to get a bit more solid and I'll be merging that work into our master branch tonight so the others can start testing and working with it too.

I'm not super happy with performance in a few cases so I'll be going back to that but there is a lot of other stuff to do first.

To finish off tonight I need to do a little work on the asset building tool and then tomorrow will probably be when I start looking at refactoring a bunch of the code around joining campaigns and other network related stuff.

Seeya tomorrow

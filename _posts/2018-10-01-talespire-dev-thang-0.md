Evening all! I really need to start doing my daily signoffs somewhere people can see.. so here we are!

Most of my work these days is rewriting systems from the prototype you may have seen on the streams. As you can imagine there are lots of things that were hacked in to see how they would feel but were never fleshed out. Today I was working on the sync of state from scriptable tiles. Currently only the state-machine script we are using for the doors and chests is using this change but it's now easy for us to expand on.

I also finally let my partner try out the building system (see it's not just you folks who haven't been let in :D) and have a big ol' list of things to change. Many are things we knew about but it's always good to get fresh eyes on it.

This weekend I'm off to [@jonnyree's](https://twitter.com/jonnyree?lang=en) place so we can plan out the rewrite of the floor and fog-of-war systems so expect news on that next week.

Tomorrow I think I'm going to look at basic undo-redo and see what feels nice when you have multiple people editting the board at the same time.

That's it for now.

Peace

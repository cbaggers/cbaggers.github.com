Heya folks, today is going very well so far.

You may have seen us talk about switching to our new backend infrastructure today. That went relatively smoothly, with only a few things to tweak for next time.
I don't want to steal @Borodust's thunder by going into all the details of what he is doing, but I certainly sleep more easily these days seeing what is being built. We are on the road to a much more maintainable system, and the news insights we have into our servers mean we finally have some tools to start doing a decent job of seeing problems coming rather than reacting to everything. Of course, it's still early days, but I'm naturally pumped about it.

Next up, Ree, myself, and Chairmander have all been merging in bits and pieces for Symbiotes. I've squashed the bugs I needed to handle before the beta, Ree merged in the UI, and Chairmander has the latest improvement to the docs (and supporting code) based on your feedback thus far.

I've got a candidate build running through our build system now, so I will go kick the tires on that and see how it goes.

Have a good one!
